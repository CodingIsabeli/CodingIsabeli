- 👩🏽‍💻 Hi, I’m Isabeli!
- 💻 I'm interested in learning several programming languages, as well as becoming a full-stack dev in the future;
- 😉 I'm currently learning PHP and improving myself in both Python and databases;
- 💞️ For now, I'm focused on improving my web development skills, especially PHP. I already have solid knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I am constantly looking for new ways to make my web creations more interactive and dynamic;
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started the IT technical course in vocational education, being mostly driven by hardware, however, when I started looking at programming, I discovered my real path.
